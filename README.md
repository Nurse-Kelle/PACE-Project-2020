Code Blue Analysis - SICU
Intro
The American Heart Association (AHA) states that 475,000 Americans die from a cardiac arrest every year. “Globally,
cardiac arrest claims more lives than colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, influenza, pneumonia, auto
accidents, HIV, firearms, and house fires combined” (AHA 2020). A more concerning statistic from the AHA shows adult
survival rates from In-Hospital Cardiac Arrests from 2012-2016 all falling below 26% with the incidence being 209,000.

Proposal
Use the data from the ZOLL to analyze cardiopulmonary resuscitation administered during a code blue response. This
analysis can be used to establish a performance baseline, gain insights to what areas of CPR techniques are lacking,
educate fellow staff members, and track improvement.
